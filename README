My dotfiles for OS X and Linux.

To install:
  git clone git://github.com/cdmwebs/dotfiles.git
  cd dotfiles
  rake install

rails.vim by tpope is included as a submodule. To update after first install, just:
  cd dotfiles
  git submodule update

Since the files were symlinked initally, you're up to date!

If you do fork, make sure to change your gitconfig to match your name and email address!
